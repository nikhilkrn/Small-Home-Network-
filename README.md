# 🏠 Small Home Network Configuration

This project simulates a basic home network using **coaxial cable connections** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, created as part of Cisco's **Networking Basics** course.

## 🔧 Features

- Coaxial cable–based network topology
- Basic IP addressing setup
- Device-to-device communication
- Router, switch, and PC configuration
- Hands-on simulation for foundational networking skills

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of different network devices
- Configure IP addresses and test connectivity
- Visualize data flow in small-scale networks
- Practice troubleshooting with simulation tools

## 📁 Files Included

- `Small_home_network.pka` – Cisco Packet Tracer project file

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Explore the topology and inspect configurations.
3. Modify IPs or add new devices to practice further.
4. Use simulation mode to observe packet movement.

## 📌 Note

This is an educational project built to demonstrate core concepts in home networking. It is not intended for production use.
